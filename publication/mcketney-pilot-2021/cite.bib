 abstract = {Proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) holds great promise in understanding the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). As one of the primary reservoirs of neuronal biomolecules, CSF provides a window into the biochemical and cellular aspects of the neurological environment. CSF can be drawn from living participants allowing the potential alignment of clinical changes with these biochemical markers. Using cutting-edge mass spectrometry technologies, we perform a streamlined proteomic analysis of CSF. We quantify greater than 700 proteins across 10 pairs of age- and sex-matched participants in approximately one hour of analysis time each. Using the paired participant study structure, we identify a small group of biologically relevant proteins that show substantial changes in abundance between cognitive normal and AD participants, which were then analyzed at the peptide level using parallel reaction monitoring experiments. Our findings suggest the utility of fractionating a single sample and using matching to increase proteomic depth in cerebrospinal fluid, as well as the potential power of an expanded study.
