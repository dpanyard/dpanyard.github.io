      <title>EDI statement</title>
      <link>https://dpanyard.github.io/project/edi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A welcoming and inclusive environment is essential to a healthy research lab. The practice of science requires the confidence to take intellectual risks, but such confidence can be undermined in settings where students or scientists feel excluded. In epidemiology and bio-data science, where a wide range of skills and experiences across biology, statistics, and computer science are required, it can be especially daunting to students who are already being asked to step outside of their academic comfort zone. Encouraging mentors and advisors are crucial to ensure that students and colleagues feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my training, I have experienced positive research environments from a diverse group of research mentors, and these experiences now guide how I have treated the diverse group of mentees I have had. For instance, since most students are unfamiliar with either the basics of genetics or the basics of computer programming, I have created a series of training modules for each subject area our research involves. As I get to know a new mentee, I work with them to find out what skills they want to grow in to feel confident in their work with me, and then I hold a series of one-on-one meetings where we review the training modules on those topics so that they can get a head start on learning those skills. The modularization allows me to tailor these learning tasks to each individual student’s background. In a broader sense, too, I take care to check in with students about academic and scientific terminology we encounter. It can be isolating to not understand the nuances of the academic world, so I make sure to contextualize terminology about graduate school, scientific publishing, and grants as needed for my students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move further in my career, I look forward to being able to continue these efforts. Working in the context of population cohorts especially provides opportunities to promote diversity and inclusion. In large-scale genetic studies, working with diverse populations provides benefits to a broader range of the public, increases the generalizability of results, provides novel insights into health and disease. Community-based studies are also an opportunity to give back to the communities participating in the research. I have been inspired by work I have seen at the University of Wisconsin in Alzheimer’s disease, where the scientists conducting the research hold regular events with the community to share the highlights of the research that community has enabled through their participation. I would enjoy the chance to support or organize similar efforts with the communities I end up working with. Outside of a cohort study, I would also like to continue my outreach to undergraduates and high school students. I have been able to speak to several different high schools already about the work that I do, including in communities where science research is not a common career path. I would like to continue this outreach to schools, particularly those serving students who may be more educationally disadvantaged. These efforts could be supplemented with recorded talks and activities that could be more broadly disseminated online, which would further increase the outreach possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching statement</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-teaching-philosophy&#34;&gt;Overall teaching philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and education go hand-in-hand. Well-taught, empowered students make for effective and independent new researchers, who in turn make for more self-motivated and ambitious students and trainees. Effective teaching builds technical and theoretical competency in the evaluation, planning, and execution of scientific research that prepares students to hit the ground running when they begin research. Prepared students work faster and create higher quality work, which grants a sense of accomplishment and progress that helps sustain their motivation through tougher periods of work. Effective teaching also builds interest in the discipline being taught among the student body. When students build concrete skills through their coursework, they can more easily see themselves as researchers using those skills, increasing their confidence enough that they may choose to pursue research opportunities with their professor or similar researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For research faculty, these skills and interest in research are important traits to foster in a graduate or undergraduate program. Overall interest in the program will grow, fueling a stronger applicant pool for graduate programs and research labs, leading to trainees who can more effectively contribute. Solid skills-oriented teaching, then, is a crucial component for sustained success as a research faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;approach-to-teaching-and-mentoring&#34;&gt;Approach to teaching and mentoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through mentoring, guest lecturing, and participation in the University of Wisconsin Teaching Academy as an affiliate member, I have been able to practice and solidify my philosophy of teaching. Two of the most important concepts underlying my approach to teaching and mentoring are backward design and scaffolding. Backward design emphasizes the identification of end goals first and then creating learning experiences and tasks to attain those goals. Scaffolding, on the other hand, is the intentional progression of tasks that slowly lead to student independence. For a field as interdisciplinary as epidemiology and bio-data science, these education techniques are powerful ways to build competency quickly and effectively across a diversity of skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, in preparing my material for a guest lecture on genetic analysis techniques in the Genetic Epidemiology course at the University of Wisconsin-Madidson, I used a backward design approach for my lecture. I began by identifying the most important information students needed to know about polygenic risk score analysis and Mendelian randomization, and then I designed my lecture to emphasize those key points clearly and repeatedly. One specific example: to ensure that students walked away with an understanding of when you would and would not want to use a polygenic score analysis, I designed a think-pair-share activity to allow students to think through the potential benefits and issues on their own before discussing the answers as a group. In this same class, we used a scaffolding approach to design their practical lab for genetic data cleaning and analysis. We began with a simple tutorial to get students acclimated to Unix server navigation, then gave students simple data cleaning tasks to execute with a carefully curated data set for them to use, and then finally gave students larger assignments to conduct a complete genetic analysis similar to what one might do in practice. Although many students entered the class with no previous experience with Unix servers and genetic data, they left the practical lab able to complete a genome-wide association analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have approached my mentorship of undergraduate students with a similar backward design and scaffolding framework. I begin research projects with my mentees by first identifying what their objectives are for their rotation and how to align those with the needs of the lab. Then, I plan for them a series of progressive tasks and responsibilities to meet those objectives in the time available. For instance, with one student, we identified our goal to be the implementation of several different genetic prediction models for metabolites. I assessed what skills they needed to learn to complete this task and then created a skills-building schedule, with a mix of topical, one-on-one discussions and self-guided tutorials for the student to acquire the skills they needed in time to complete the task in the semester, which they were able to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
