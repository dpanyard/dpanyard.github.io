As these proteins can be monitored by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures, the AD proteome in CSF has been of particular interest. Here, we conducted a proteome-wide assessment of the CSF in an AD cohort among participants with and without AD pathology (n = 137 total participants: 56 A-T-, 39 A+T-, and 42 A+T+; 915 proteins analyzed), identifying a diverse set of proteins in the CSF enriched for extracellular and immune system processes. We then interrogated the proteome using the amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN) framework of AD and a panel of 9 CSF biomarkers for neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. After multiple testing correction, we identified a total of 61 proteins significantly associated with AT group (P textless 5.46 x 10-5; strongest was SMOC1, P = 1.87 x 10-12) and 636 significant protein-biomarker associations (P textless 6.07 x 10-6; strongest was a positive association between neurogranin and EPHA4, P = 2.42 x 10-25) across all measures except for interleukin-6, which had no significantly associated proteins. Community network and pathway enrichment analyses highlighted three biomarker-associated protein networks: one related to amyloid and tau measures, one to CSF neurogranin, and one to the remaining CSF biomarkers. Glucose metabolic pathways were enriched primarily among the amyloid- and tau-associated proteins, including malate dehydrogenase and aldolase A, both of which were replicated as strongly associated with AD (P = 1.07 x 10-19 and P = 7.43 x 10-14, respectively) in an independent CSF proteomics cohort (n = 717 participants). Comparative performance of the CSF proteome in predicting AT categorization was high (mean AUC range 0.891-0.924 with number of protein predictors ranging from 37-97) relative to other omic predictors from the genome, CSF metabolome, and demographics from the same cohort of individuals. Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of the CSF proteome relative to other omics and implicate glucose metabolic dysregulation as amyloid and tau pathology emerges in AD.","tags":null,"title":"Large-scale proteome analysis of CSF implicates altered glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel J.

Our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying AD has benefited from genomic analyses, including those that leverage polygenic risk score (PRS) models of disease. In many aspects of genomic research the use of functional annotation has been able to improve the power of genomic models. Here, we leveraged genomic functional annotations to build tissue-specific PRS models for 13 tissues and applied the scores to two longitudinal cohort studies of AD. The PRS model that was most predictive of AD diagnosis relative to cognitively unimpaired participants was the liver tissue score: n = 1,116; odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 2.19 (1.70-2.82) per standard deviation (SD) increase in PRS; P = 1.46 x 10$^textrm-9$. After removing the APOE locus from the PRS models, the liver score was the only PRS to remain statistically significantly associated with AD diagnosis after multiple testing correction, although the effect was weaker: OR (95% CI) = 1.55 (1.19-2.02) per SD increase in PRS; P = 0.0012. In follow-up analysis, the liver PRS was statistically significantly associated with levels of amyloid (P = 3.53 x 10$^textrm-6$) and tau (P = 1.45 x 10$^textrm-5$) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (when the APOE locus was included) and nominally associated with CSF soluble TREM2 levels (P = 0.042) (when the APOE locus was excluded).

This study aimed to implement a rheumatology staff-driven protocol, Quit Connect, to increase the rate of electronic referrals (e-referrals) to free, state-run tobacco quit lines (TQL). METHODS: We conducted a quasi-experimental cohort study of Quit Connect at three rheumatology clinics comparing TQL referrals from four baseline years to referrals during a six-month intervention period. Nurses and medical assistants were trained to use two standardized electronic health record (EHR) prompts to Check readiness to quit smoking within 30 days, Advise cessation, and Connect patients using TQL e-referral orders. We used EHR data to examine the primary outcome of TQL referrals using pre-post design. RESULTS: Across 54,090 pre- and post-protocol rheumatology clinic visits, 4,601 were with current smokers. We compared outcomes between 4,078 eligible pre-implementation visits and 523 intervention period visits. Post-implementation, the odds of TQL referral were 26-fold higher compared to our pre-implementation rate (unadjusted OR 26, CI 6-106). Adjusted odds of checking readiness to quit in the next 30 days increased over 100-fold compared to pre-implementation (adjusted OR 132, CI 99-177). Intervention led to e-referrals for 71% of quit-ready patients in textless90 seconds; 24% of referred patients reported a quit attempt. CONCLUSION: Implementing Quit Connect in rheumatology clinics was feasible and improved referrals to a state-run TQL. Given the importance of smoking cessation to reduce cardiopulmonary and rheumatic disease risk, future studies should investigate disseminating cessation protocols like Quit Connect that leverage TQLs.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of a Rheumatology Clinic Protocol on Tobacco Cessation Quit Line Referrals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justin McKetney","Daniel J.

Here, we present a metabolome-wide association study (MWAS), which uses genetic and metabolomic data to impute metabolites into large samples with genome-wide association summary statistics. We conduct a metabolome-wide, genome-wide association analysis with 338 CSF metabolites, identifying 16 genotype-metabolite associations (metabolite quantitative trait loci, or mQTLs).

The practice of science requires the confidence to take intellectual risks, but such confidence can be undermined in settings where students or scientists feel excluded. In epidemiology and bio-data science, where a wide range of skills and experiences across biology, statistics, and computer science are required, it can be especially daunting to students who are already being asked to step outside of their academic comfort zone. Encouraging mentors and advisors are crucial to ensure that students and colleagues feel welcome.\nIn my training, I have experienced positive research environments from a diverse group of research mentors, and these experiences now guide how I have treated the diverse group of mentees I have had. For instance, since most students are unfamiliar with either the basics of genetics or the basics of computer programming, I have created a series of training modules for each subject area our research involves. As I get to know a new mentee, I work with them to find out what skills they want to grow in to feel confident in their work with me, and then I hold a series of one-on-one meetings where we review the training modules on those topics so that they can get a head start on learning those skills. The modularization allows me to tailor these learning tasks to each individual studentâs background. In a broader sense, too, I take care to check in with students about academic and scientific terminology we encounter. It can be isolating to not understand the nuances of the academic world, so I make sure to contextualize terminology about graduate school, scientific publishing, and grants as needed for my students.\nAs I move further in my career, I look forward to being able to continue these efforts. Working in the context of population cohorts especially provides opportunities to promote diversity and inclusion. In large-scale genetic studies, working with diverse populations provides benefits to a broader range of the public, increases the generalizability of results, provides novel insights into health and disease. Community-based studies are also an opportunity to give back to the communities participating in the research. I have been inspired by work I have seen at the University of Wisconsin in Alzheimerâs disease, where the scientists conducting the research hold regular events with the community to share the highlights of the research that community has enabled through their participation. I would enjoy the chance to support or organize similar efforts with the communities I end up working with. Outside of a cohort study, I would also like to continue my outreach to undergraduates and high school students. I have been able to speak to several different high schools already about the work that I do, including in communities where science research is not a common career path. I would like to continue this outreach to schools, particularly those serving students who may be more educationally disadvantaged. These efforts could be supplemented with recorded talks and activities that could be more broadly disseminated online, which would further increase the outreach possible.\n","date":1576540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576540800,"objectID":"780bd26e7be290755dc081e8d4946726","permalink":"https://dpanyard.github.io/project/edi/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/edi/","section":"project","summary":"Approach to supporting equity, diversity, and inclusion","tags":null,"title":"EDI statement","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overall teaching philosophy Research and education go hand-in-hand. Well-taught, empowered students make for effective and independent new researchers, who in turn make for more self-motivated and ambitious students and trainees. Effective teaching builds technical and theoretical competency in the evaluation, planning, and execution of scientific research that prepares students to hit the ground running when they begin research. Prepared students work faster and create higher quality work, which grants a sense of accomplishment and progress that helps sustain their motivation through tougher periods of work. Effective teaching also builds interest in the discipline being taught among the student body. When students build concrete skills through their coursework, they can more easily see themselves as researchers using those skills, increasing their confidence enough that they may choose to pursue research opportunities with their professor or similar researchers.\nFor research faculty, these skills and interest in research are important traits to foster in a graduate or undergraduate program. Overall interest in the program will grow, fueling a stronger applicant pool for graduate programs and research labs, leading to trainees who can more effectively contribute. Solid skills-oriented teaching, then, is a crucial component for sustained success as a research faculty member.\nApproach to teaching and mentoring Through mentoring, guest lecturing, and participation in the University of Wisconsin Teaching Academy as an affiliate member, I have been able to practice and solidify my philosophy of teaching. Two of the most important concepts underlying my approach to teaching and mentoring are backward design and scaffolding. Backward design emphasizes the identification of end goals first and then creating learning experiences and tasks to attain those goals. Scaffolding, on the other hand, is the intentional progression of tasks that slowly lead to student independence. For a field as interdisciplinary as epidemiology and bio-data science, these education techniques are powerful ways to build competency quickly and effectively across a diversity of skills.\nAs an example, in preparing my material for a guest lecture on genetic analysis techniques in the Genetic Epidemiology course at the University of Wisconsin-Madidson, I used a backward design approach for my lecture. I began by identifying the most important information students needed to know about polygenic risk score analysis and Mendelian randomization, and then I designed my lecture to emphasize those key points clearly and repeatedly. One specific example: to ensure that students walked away with an understanding of when you would and would not want to use a polygenic score analysis, I designed a think-pair-share activity to allow students to think through the potential benefits and issues on their own before discussing the answers as a group. In this same class, we used a scaffolding approach to design their practical lab for genetic data cleaning and analysis. We began with a simple tutorial to get students acclimated to Unix server navigation, then gave students simple data cleaning tasks to execute with a carefully curated data set for them to use, and then finally gave students larger assignments to conduct a complete genetic analysis similar to what one might do in practice. Although many students entered the class with no previous experience with Unix servers and genetic data, they left the practical lab able to complete a genome-wide association analysis.\nI have approached my mentorship of undergraduate students with a similar backward design and scaffolding framework. I begin research projects with my mentees by first identifying what their objectives are for their rotation and how to align those with the needs of the lab. Then, I plan for them a series of progressive tasks and responsibilities to meet those objectives in the time available. For instance, with one student, we identified our goal to be the implementation of several different genetic prediction models for metabolites. I assessed what skills they needed to learn to complete this task and then created a skills-building schedule, with a mix of topical, one-on-one discussions and self-guided tutorials for the student to acquire the skills they needed in time to complete the task in the semester, which they were able to achieve.\n","date":1576540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576540800,"objectID":"5c479fab982ddb6e73ba0d38d23886d3","permalink":"https://dpanyard.github.io/project/teaching/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/teaching/","section":"project","summary":"Approach to teaching and mentoring","tags":null,"title":"Teaching statement","type":"project"},{"authors":["Christie M.

We aimed to adapt and implement a specialty clinic protocol, BP Connect, to improve timely primary care follow-up after high BPs in rheumatology clinics. METHODS: We examined BP Connect in a six-month pre- post- quasi-experimental design with 24-month follow-up in three academic rheumatology clinics. Medical assistants and nurses were trained to (1) check, re-measuring BPs â¥140/90, (2) advise, linking rheumatic and cardiovascular diseases, and (3) connect, timely (textless4 weeks) primary care follow-up using protocolled electronic health record (EHR) orders. We used EHR data and multivariable logistic regression to examine the primary outcome of timely primary care follow-up for patients with in-network primary care. Staff surveys assessed perceptions. Interrupted time-series analysis examined sustainability and clinic population BP trends. RESULTS: Across both 4,683 pre-implementation and 689 post-implementation rheumatology visits with high BP, 2,789 (57%) were eligible for in-network primary care follow-up. Post-implementation, the odds of timely primary care BP follow-up doubled (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9). Median time to follow-up declined from 71 to 38 days. Moreover, rheumatology visits with high BP declined from 17% to 8% over 24-months, suggesting significant population-level declines (ptextless0.01).

The LTA was performed on PBMCs of 10 patients hypersensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (HS) and 10 drug-tolerant controls (TOL), using two cytotoxicity assays: YO-PRO (n = 20) and MTT (n = 12). mRNA expression profiles of PBMCs, enriched for CD8+ T cells, were compared between HS and TOL patients. Transcript expression was interrogated for correlation with % cytotoxicity from YO-PRO and MTT assays. Correlated transcripts of interest were validated by qPCR. LTA results were not significantly different between HS and TOL patients, and no transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between the two groups. 96 transcripts were correlated with cytotoxicity by YO-PRO (r = Â±.63-.75, FDR 0.188). Transcripts were selected for validation based on mechanistic plausibility and three were significantly over-expressed by qPCR in high cytotoxicity patients: multi-specific organic anion transporter C (ABCC5), mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37), and Porimin (TMEM123).

Methods A root cause analysis was performed post-implementation to understand what led to stakeholder creep. HIT project stakeholders were given a questionnaire to comment on these misconceptions and a proposed implementation tool to help mitigate stakeholder creep. Findings Stakeholder creep contributed to an unexpected increase in time (3-month delayed go-live) and effort (68% over expected HIT work hours). Four main clinician/researcher misconceptions were identified that contributed to the development of stakeholder creep: 1) that EHR IT is a single group; 2) that all EHR IT members know the entire EHR functionality; 3) that changes to an EHR need the input of just a single EHR IT member; and 4) that the technological complexity of a project mirrors the clinical complexity. HIT project stakeholders similarly perceived clinicians/researchers to hold these misconceptions. The proposed stakeholder planning tool was perceived to be feasible and helpful. Conclusions Stakeholder creep can negatively affect HIT project implementations. Projects may be susceptible to stakeholder creep when clinicians/researchers hold misconceptions related to HIT organization and processes.

Despite this, little is known about smoking cessation counseling by rheumatologists. ObjectivesÂ We examined predictors of tobacco counseling in RA patients who smoke including the effect of perceived RA control. We hypothesized that patients with controlled RA would receive more counseling according to the competing demands model, which explains that preventive care gaps occur as a result of competing provider, patient, and clinic factors. MethodsÂ This secondary data analysis involved RA patients with an additional cardiovascular disease risk factor identified in an academic medical center 2004â2011. Trained abstractors assessed documented smoking counseling and rheumatologistsâ impression of RA control in clinic notes. We used multivariable logistic regression to predict having received smoking cessation counseling, including sociodemographics and comorbidity in models. ResultsÂ We abstracted 3396 RA visits, including 360 visits (10%) with active smokers. Perceived controlled RA was present in 31% of visits involving smokers (39% in nonsmokers). Beyond nurse documentation, providers documented smoking status in 39% of visit notes with smokers and smoking cessation counseling in 10%. Visits with controlled versus active RA were less likely to include counseling (odds ratio, 0.3; confidence interval, 0.1â0.97). Counseling was more likely in visits with prevalent cardiovascular, pulmonary, and psychiatric disease, but decreased with obesity. ConclusionsÂ Smoking cessation counseling was documented in 10% of visits and was less likely when RA was controlled. Given smokingâs impact on RA and long-term outcomes, systematic cessation counseling efforts are needed.","tags":null,"title":"Rheumatologists Modestly More Likely to Counsel Smokers in Visits Without Rheumatoid Arthritis Control: An Observational Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christie M.

Disassembly of these junctions is seen consequent to the development of autoantibodies directed at specific desmosomal proteins in blistering skin diseases such as pemphigus. However, many details regarding cell junction activity under normal physiological and disease conditions remain to be elucidated. Because of their complex structure, desmosomal junctions are not well suited to existing techniques for high-resolution three-dimensional structure-function analyses. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used for detailed characterization and visualization of the cell junctions of human epithelial cells. We demonstrate the ability to image the detailed three-dimensional structure of the cell junction at high magnification. In addition, the effect of specific antibody binding to desmosomal components of the cell junction is studied in longitudinal analyses before and after antibody treatment. We show that antibodies directed against desmoglein 3 (a major component of the desmosomal structural unit, and the major target of autoantibodies in patients with pemphigus vulgaris) are associated with changes at the cell surface of the human keratinocytes and alterations within keratinocyte intercellular adhesion structures, supporting the assertion that cell structures and junctions are modified by antibody binding. The present study indicates that the molecular structure of gap junctions can be more completely analyzed and characterized by AFM, offering a new technological approach to facilitate a better understanding of disease mechanisms and potentially monitor therapeutic strategies in blistering skin diseases. From the Clinical Editor Disassembly of desmosomal junctions is seen in blistering skin diseases such as Pemphigus. This present study demonstrates that the molecular structure of gap junctions can be more completely analyzed and characterized by atomic force microscopy.","tags":["AFM","Cell contacts","Cell junctions","Desmosome","Human keratinocyte"],"title":"Investigation of human keratinocyte cell adhesion using atomic force microscopy","type":"publication"}]
